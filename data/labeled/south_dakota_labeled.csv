"I went here on the recommendation of a friend, because my car had a check engine light. He charged me a wopping $40 just to plug the machine in and get a reading. I should have gotten it done for free at O'Reilly's.",Negative
Best lamb korma and kheer that I've ever had. Absolutely delicious! The lunch buffet is also excellent.,Positive
Great.,Positive
Clean and the place was a very good experience,Positive
"Walked in and two employees were talking to each other. Neither one offered to help in the boot department. And it's not like they were busy, heck I was 1 of 2 in the store! Last time I was in there the gentlemen had no knowledge on the boots, NOTHING! Clean house, get some people that have knowledge of the products they sell",Negative
They are a warehouse storage unit place you have the wrong idea of what they do check your costumer info.,Negative
I had fun and found my dress thanks to Chung I enjoyed my time there she was very helpful and friendly and made the experience awesome.,Positive
Very beautiful country. I would've rather rode my motorcycle down it instead of driving my wife's car. A couple spots are pretty narrow but it was well worth the drive.,Positive
I love this book store.  So much in every category you can imagine.,Positive
Had a great first experience here. It's a very cozy atmosphere that is clean and all the employees are friendly.,Positive
Jason's team is always ready to help and give great insurance advice! I've never felt that they are just there to sell you.,Positive
"This hotel was as friendly comfortable and convenient as when we stayed 3 years ago.  Our schedule only allowed one night Hill City but we made sure to stay here.  It was a guaranteed night for relaxing and rest. This is a great location to stay when you are visiting all the lovely local sights.  Easy to get to Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse, ride the steam train...even to use as a base if you want to go further afield to Rapid City, Chapel in the Hills, etc.",Positive
"Was really excited to eat here based on the website. The long wait, poor service and bad food didn’t live up to my expectations. The smoke jumper stout was good though.",Positive
Month unlimited wash is only 19.95,Negative
Average service average food,Positive
It was a dream come true for me!! It was the 50 anniversary - my grandmother came Norway I had heard stories and seen pictures of chapels in Norway.  It is something I will carry with me forever.  If you have Norwegian heredity it is a must place you must see.  The beauty the reverence of what truly God is.,Positive
Excellent food and very good service.,Positive
"Great management; I feel like they actually know me as a person, not just a paying tenant. Maintenance is quick and efficient. Its quieter than most apartments I've lived in. Apartments have great layout and feel comfortable.

I move a lot for my job, but every time I come back to Rapid, this is my top choice to call home.",Positive
The bears were hilarious to watch and didn't care about the cars around,Negative
I was lucky. Got loaded in 1 h. Good.,Positive
"The staff were courteous, very nice and did everything they could to help us book an affordable room. Rooms are immaculate.",Positive
Great place for breakfast.  And the carrot cake is divine.,Positive

Great place to locate gard to find items,Positive
"I wouldn't give this place a one out of five if it was possible. First sign was walking in to the building by our room the exterior door is broken so anyone can get in. I uploaded some pictures of my room. I found the reason why it says absolutely no refunds on rooms. This place is a sh!+ Hole. Bathroom is disgusting. Blood stains on the curtains. Stains on bed sheets. Burned out light bulbs. Wire coming out of light fixtures. Bed mounting bolts are pulled out of the wall. The bathroom faucet is missing the airator, so it blasts water all over when turned on. The bathroom floors are dirty. Bathroom towel rack is broken and falling down. Curtains are falling off of the rods and pulling away from the wall. TV is old and a little on the small side. Hallway smells like cigarette smoke. Bed is under par worse than sleeping on a crappy futon, atleast there are three small couch pillows. Shower is small about the size of an RV shower. To top it off there is no hot water in the shower Don't waste your time or money! You will want to leave but you won't even get your money back. Boycott this place.",Negative
Terrible rude. Lied about state law to wear mask. Will never come back,Negative
Great selection of shops.,Positive
"Basically a one stop shop for about anything. Prices aren't anything to brag about, but it's nice to just have to make one stop.",Positive
"Fantastic pizza. Great marinara sauce and crust. Had ""Luigi's Hidden Star"", dang so good. Had a little difficulty finding it as it is behind the location that game up on Google navigation.",Positive
Good food...Nice atmosphere...Great service. They have a varied variety of food including buffalo and wagyu beef.,Positive
Free & fun for kids,Positive
Ok,Positive
Breakfast is amazing!!!,Positive
"I've used Carson for a window project in my home this spring and he did a great job.  Fair pricing, great work ethic and really worked to do a good job.

I also own a commercial services company that has followed up with the post construction clean up of his work.  Carson did a fantastic job on the remodel and cleaned up after himself extremely well making my job as a carpet cleaning contractor and post construction clean up extremely easy.  My crew pointed out that they would LOVE to follow up after Carson more often.  It's always nice to see someone take pride in their work and clean up.

Carson is booked up a lot-- The good ones usually are in his trade.  If you get a chance to work with him you will not be disappointed in his devotion to his work",Positive
Great food. Great people,Positive
"Great,  friendly.  Such a wonderful option for shopping in the community! Thank you Dollar General!",Positive
A little too spendy. Waitress a little spacey. But best pizza in town!!!,Positive
Plenty of parking and good retail location,Positive
"You can never win!  Machines, or the table.",Negative
"Dope breakfast on my end but pass on the eggs Benny if you want a proper poach, usually come out overdone(more than 2 experiences). That being said the French toast is killer and the syrup they use has some undefinable smokiness to it, delicious!",Positive
"My husband was sceptical, but we really enjoyed our visit. Definitely recommend the Alligator show. We really enjoyed learning about all the rare snakes that Reptile Gardens has. Great for the family.",Positive
"We just drove by it this last time, didn't go there",Negative
"Unexpected car repairs are always stressful and I'm thrilled to say I've found my go-to auto repair shop. My ignition switch recently failed and J & M Transmission was able to get me in the same day while approaching the problem with my pocketbook in mind. Their customer service is courteous and put my mind at ease by initially giving me a guess at the price range I could expect, along with the promise to not start any extensive repairs without calling me and reviewing the ""diagnosis"" and solutions. The mechanical failure was, thankfully, not major and they had me back on the road within a couple hours. I'll happily give them my business in the future.",Positive
Thank you Anthony!!   This was the easiest buying experience in a long time.  Usually have to deal with a bunch of paperwork.  Anthony is very down to earth and answered all of the questions that I had.  I even asked the dumb ones.   Not likely but leaning towards sending him a COWBOYS poster for his office.  Ha Ha!!,Positive
"Jeff was wonderful.   Prompt, professional and very attentive to detail.  Appreciate so much the timely service.   Grateful for everything.",Positive
Prices are astronomical but they know they are the only place for repair around. Wouldn't recommend it if you can help it.,Negative
Good bbq friend someone from St Louis.  No ice cream in the machine. If so this would be 5 stars.,Negative

It was fun,Positive
Got billed for food we didn't even order & got ignored for the first 30 min after they sat us. Horrible service food ain't to bad,Negative
"Walked in hoping to to get back into Magic the Gathering for the first time since 2006 as I felt incredibly overwhelmed shopping online since the game has changed so much since then. There were about four people behind the counter working and doing tasks and about six people at tables playing games, just like the good old days. I was so excited to rejoin the Magic community and relearn the game that had driven me to the collectible card games what seemed like so long ago. They seemed incredibly skeptical as I tried to explain that I came from legacy era and had a ton of old cards but didn't know where to start in standard. I used to shop at DD a ton when it had a previous owner and loved going there every Friday for Magic nights with friends from High School and later college. I even drove from Vermillion to come here because I loved the atmosphere of the Dragon's Den. Now I feel like it doesn't really have an inviting atmosphere and the people who either work there or own it do not seem to care about bringing new people to the store or taking an active interest in their customers. I can't say that I was treated poorly but I do not feel like I was assisted as I used to be or offered a place where I could go and get away from the world. My expectations might have been too high. I may attempt to check it out again at a later date but I was quite disappointed with the service provided and hope that others who have interest in joining MTG or other games that DD sells would be given a better experience.",Negative
I slept very well a fair value,Positive
Very gracious and accommodating 😊,Positive
"Very well appointed rooms and very clean. Comfortable beds. Very nice view of the river out my window. Breakfast quality not quite up to par with the rest of the hotel nor is the fitness center though the pool, I didn't use, looks very nice.",Positive
Good service!,Positive
"Not as good as Grandma's fried chicken, but for pizza it's hard to beat.",Negative
"I really love my Hy-Vee, they are always so friendly and helpful 😁😁😍",Positive
"Great people, professional work.   I could not be more pleased with the work they did for me.",Positive
"My husband and I split  the SUPER CINCO PLATTER each time we go there. It makes it really convenient. It's not super expensive to begin with, but there is enough on the Platter to divide between us and it all gets eaten :) Everyone there is extremely nice and make it worth going. I would recommend CHEVY'S to anyone! Thank you for being so great!!",Positive
"It was time to upgrade to a new phone so out of convenience, I went to the closest Verizon location. I told them I would like help with transferring over my data from my old phone. I was given a printout of “do it yourself” instructions. They didn’t even take my new phone out the box (which was a new experience). I again commented that I wasn’t confident in my ability to set up the new phone—the sales associate went over the handout with me again and sent me on my way. I was told my old phone would work until the new phone was powered on. However, this was not the case. My old phone did not work and my new phone was still wrapped in a box. I spent about one hour trying to transfer all my data without any luck and then decided to try a different Verizon location. Thank goodness I did. Going forward, I will only go to this Verizon location. The service wasn’t fast, but that’s because they are extremely thorough and helpful. They aren’t just pushing people out he door—they are helping them. It’s worth the wait!!! After my first rushed experience at another location, this was a breath of fresh air. Jason Lamkin was able to transfer all my data over (which was more complicated than usual because I was trying to merge two different sets of data) and I left not only happy but relieved. I highly recommend this location to anyone that wants personalized service.",Positive
🔥🔥🔥,Negative
Service was great. .food great as always,Positive

Good food & service.,Positive
A very good place to go & have a nice  evening!!,Positive

"Shopping, food, at one great location...what more do you want??",Positive
was enjoying the store and the employees until yesterday when i purchased a vape that had 1600 puffs didn’t even have it for an hour and it was already blinking. i better get a refund.,Negative
"Of course it's awesome,it's a national park! Wonderful drive through lunar landscapes,giant prairie dog towns,and sharp rugged cliffs.On our visit,we saw bison,prairie dogs,big horn sheep,and mule deer.My wife also found 2 fossils which were documented with the park service.Don't miss out on a chance to visit any national park.",Positive
"Absolutely beautiful park.  Worth a detour drive-through if you're travelling on I-90, but also has a lot of short hikes if you have more time.  I would highly suggest Notch Trail, it is by far my favorite in the park.  The round trip takes me about 45 minutes (26 year old male).  If you have even more time and it's a clear day, stay after nightfall to attend the night sky program at the amphitheater.  The park has one of the darkest skies around, so it is well worth your time.",Positive
Great facility and amazing providers. EZ to get an appointment and call center receivers are super nice and understanding.  We instantly liked Dr. Strausburg  when we met with her. She is very detailed and professional. She takes time with her patients and is a committed and compassionate doctor.  We love her and hope to be her patients for a long time.,Positive
It was awesome!,Positive
"The food is always amazing when I go, and I've been at all hours of the day, be it lunch rush, or middle of the night.",Positive
BEST PLACE EVER!!,Positive
"We were very pleasantly surprised by our dinner at Ruby Tuesday. The food, for a chain restaurant, was excellent. I had the pork chop, and it was as tender as you could wish, with lots of flavor. Even better, the broccoli was cooked to perfection, much better than I have experienced in far more expensive restaurants. Sounds kind of odd praising the broccoli, but if a kitchen can cook their vegetables this well, the rest of the meal will be outstanding. -:)",Positive
Had late lunch -house special pot pie for husband and mac and cheese for me saving room for pie a la mode dessert. Pie was great ice cream even better. I had cherry he had blueberry. Super Yummy!,Positive
Service was fast,Positive
Did a very good job on our camper,Positive

Really cool side of the road stop,Positive
