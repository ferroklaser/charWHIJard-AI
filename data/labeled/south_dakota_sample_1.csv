Motel 6 Hot Springs SD,"Motel, Hotel","Stayed in room 219 for 2 nights during the eclipse.  Our room was freshly renovated and the new floors are great.  The beds are a bit hard though and there should be at least 1 or 2 more pillows per bed in such a trendy room.  I would also have an extra blanket in one of the open cubbys.

The room was pretty quiet except for the slam latch door closures and the fan that turns on automatically when you turn on the single bathroom  switch.  (Two of my biggest hotel pet peeves.)

Our room had a dorm 'frige and a very small microwave.  Sufficient soap, shampoo and bath towels were supplied.

There is a very small pool inside and plenty of parking, even for semi or large vehicles.

I cannot comment on any continental breakfast as I didn't not see anything other than a coffee carafe and it was extremely strong.

I visited with Mark Patel about a couple misc maintenance items I saw that could be remedied quickly.  (Carpenter's daughter, I just see this stuff.)

I'd stay here again.",989,False,False

Buying a vehicle from a dealership that cares for our community feels good. They financially support many important organizations and even care for pets by showcasing pets available for adoption with pictures  in the customer lounge.

I noticed how each salespersonâ€™s name was etched on glass at each office entry and commented on how that indicated that employees donâ€™t turnover like other dealerships. Sure enough, they confirmed just how long employees stay there.

Iâ€™m grateful for a dealership like this in our community where staff and customers are respected.",969,False,True
